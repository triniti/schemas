          The "hf" field is an array of strings, aka headline fragments, that
          are written for dramatic effect. These are good for visual display
          but don't generally read well and are not great for SEO. They're
          basically microbroetry.

      </field>
      <field name="hf_styles" type="string" format="slug" rule="list">
        <description>
          This array corresponds to the "hf" field. Any visual treatments that
          need to be applied would have a value in the same list position in
          this field. hf and hf_styles fields should always be the same length.
          E.g. "none", "upper", "blink", "strike".
